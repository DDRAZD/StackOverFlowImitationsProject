Created new project with both MVC and WebAPI
Added to the projec the SQL query used to create the database
had to remove "cascade on delete" for both answers and votes to avoid cascading path (put NO ACTION)


added the different projects (class libararies but skipped the interfaces layers, contracts, as not necessary)

data access layer is essentially built in to EF so will include it only at service layer

added image library

-------------------------
installing packages within DomainModels

install-package EntityFramework 

Installing it as well in the main project - stackoverflowproject

----------------
adding the connection string to the existing DB we built - this is in Web.Config in the main project

first, adding session time out - in the <system.web> adding 60 minutes as session timeout:
<sessionState timeout="60"></sessionState>

added:
<connectionStrings>
		<add name="StackOverflowDatabaseDBContext" connectionString="data source=localhost; Server=localhost;Database=master;Trusted_Connection=True;; initial catalog=StackOverflowDataBase" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>

at the end of the file

-----------------------------
adding domain model classes:
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

mimic the same structure you already have in the database
for the primary key, add:

 [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]

 this means this is automatically generated by the DB and used as the identity for each entry

 ----------------
 view model is binded to the view
 domain model is binded to the DB table
 -----------------

 when building the domain models, the "virtual" means it will be binded at run time. this is how you use the foregin key. you give the key within
 the model and it will pull at run time

 example: 
 [ForeignKey("CategoryID")]
 public virtual Category Category { get; set; }
 [ForeignKey("UserID")]
 public virtual User User { get; set; }
 where the IDs are columns specfiied above it as part of the Question model
